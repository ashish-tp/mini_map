for task1, I created two interfaces called ActorItemInterface and CellInterface. ActorItemInterface contains common methods from Actor class and Item class whereas CellInterface contains methods from Cell class. ActorItemInterface is implemented by Actor and Item classes, and CellInterface is implemented by Cell class.

I didn't make any changes to StageReader for this task.
